## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6) - React Router
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation library for React

### What I learned

This is my first React project outside of tutorials which I watched. This is also my first project in which I used Framer Motion library.
I've learned about importance of setting up a good folder structure, which helps a lot during a development process. The main thing I've
learned on this project are drawbacks of animating libraries. Even thought they help a lot, it's hard to make animations responsive.
This is the reason why I used some hooks which measure screen width. Everything else was practising things that I've already known, mostly.

### Continued development

I might revisit some timing functions on animations and I should also implement some logic for lazy image loading, especially on Location page.

### Useful resources

- [Colt Steele's React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) - This is a course which helped me to learn most of the stuff I know about React.
- [Wrong Akram - YT page](https://www.youtube.com/c/WrongAkram) - This is what got me interested in Framer Motion library.
- [JavaScript Mastery - YT page](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery) - Another great YT page with really usefull tutorials.
